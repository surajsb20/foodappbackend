            have downloaded the Application to a personal mobile device. You are responsible for obtaining access
            to<br/>
            the Platform and acknowledge that such access may involve third-party fees (such as Internet service<br/>
            provider access, data fees or calling rates). You are required to ensure that all persons who access
            the<br/>
            Platform through a user&#39;s internet connection are aware of these Terms and comply with them. You
            are<br/>
            responsible for any security breaches or performance issues relating to accessing the Platform.<br/>
            To become a registered User, you must create an account with us and provide certain information,<br/>
            including personal information, to us. All personal information provided by you on registration will be
            treated<br/>
            in accordance with the provisions of our privacy policy located which may be found at [INSERT LINK]<br/>
            (&quot;Company&#39;s Privacy Policy&quot;) and which is incorporated by reference into these Terms. If you
            do not<br/>
            agree with the terms of Company&#39;s Privacy Policy, DO NOT download, install or otherwise use the
            Platform.<br/>
            In consideration of your use of the Platform, you agree to provide and maintain current, complete and<br/>
            accurate information about yourself.</p>

        <p><br/>
            By accepting these Terms, you represent and warrant that you are legally capable of entering into a<br/>
            binding contract and are at least of the age of majority where you reside.<br/>
            You may only use the Platform to place Take-out Orders if you are the authorized holder of the debit<br/>
            or credit card used for payment of the Take-out Order.</p>

        <p><br/>
            All activity that occurs on your account is your sole and exclusive responsibility and we will not be liable<br/>
            for any activity occurring on your account, including, without limitation, unauthorized activity by a third
            party.</p>

        <p><br/>
            4. PROCESSING TAKE-OUT ORDERS</p>

        <p><br/>
            Once you submit a Take-out Order using the Platform and your payment for the Take-out Order has<br/>
            been authorized (debit or credit card), your Take-out Order will be transmitted to the Restaurant from which<br/>
            you ordered. Once you have submitted your Take-out Order and your payment has been authorized, you<br/>
            WILL NOT be entitled to change your order. You are responsible to ensure that all the details of your
            Takeout<br/>
            Order (including your billing and delivery address) are complete and accurate.</p>

        <p><br/>
            Any notification sent to you by the Platform confirming your Take-out Order only means that the Takeout<br/>
            Order has been received and is being processed by us, and DOES NOT necessarily mean that your<br/>
            Take-out Order has been accepted by the Restaurant. We encourage all the Restaurants to accept all<br/>
            Take-out Orders and to communicate to us any rejection promptly. We will notify you as soon as
            reasonably<br/>
            possible if a Restaurant rejects your Take-out Order. Restaurants have the discretion to reject
            Take-out<br/>
            Orders at any time and for any reason.</p>

        <p><br/>
            5. REJECTION OF TAKE-OUT ORDERS</p>

        <p><br/>
            If your Take-out Order is subsequently rejected by the Restaurant or cancelled for any other reason,<br/>
            your bank or card issuer will not transfer the funds for the Take-out Order to us, but will instead release
            the<br/>
            relevant amount back into your available balance. This may take a period of time which is entirely<br/>
            dependent upon your bank or card issuer. You acknowledge and agree that neither Company nor the<br/>
            relevant Restaurant will be responsible or liable to you in relation to any by your bank or card issuer in
            the<br/>
            release of funds back into your account.</p>

        <p><br/>
            3</p>

        <p><br/>
            6. DELIVERY OF TAKE-OUT ORDERS<br/>
            When you place a Take-out Order through the Platform for delivery to you, you may choose the time<br/>
            when you would like your Take-out Order to be delivered to you. This time is only an estimate and we<br/>
            make no guarantee that this time will be achieved. We are not responsible for any delays in receiving
            or<br/>
            having your Take-out Order ready for delivery for any reason. It is not our policy to provide a refund if
            you<br/>
            are dissatisfied with your Take-out Order. We may, in our sole discretion, provide a refund in certain<br/>
            circumstances, provided that the Restaurant also agrees to the refund.</p>

        <p><br/>
            7. PRICE AND PAYMENT</p>

        <p><br/>
            Prices will be as quoted on the Platform and will have applicable sales taxes and delivery charges<br/>
            calculated at checkout. You will be charged at the time of placing your Take-out Order. Payment for
            Takeout<br/>
            Orders will be transacted through our applicable third-party payment processor which, as at the date<br/>
            hereof, is TD Merchant Services. You consent to the collection and use of your information (including,
            if<br/>
            applicable, personal information) by such payment processing service as necessary to process your<br/>
            payment for Take-out Orders. We reserve the right to change, or to stop accepting, any permitted
            payment<br/>
            method at any time in our sole discretion. You agree that we may charge your payment card for any
            Takeout<br/>
            Order placed by you and for any additional amounts (including any taxes) as may be applicable in<br/>
            connection with your purchase. We will provide you with an online and/or emailed billing summary<br/>
            statement which you may review, save, or print at your discretion. This is the only billing statement that
            will<br/>
            be provided by us.</p>

            notice. The Platform may be unavailable from time to time due to maintenance or malfunction of computer<br/>
            or network equipment or other reasons. We may periodically add or update the information and materials<br/>
            on the Platform without notice.<br/>
            While we try to ensure the Platform is normally available twenty-four (24) hours a day, we do not<br/>
            undertake any obligation to do so, and we will not be liable to you if the Platform is unavailable at any
            time<br/>
            or for any period.</p>

        <p><br/>
            25. SECURITY</p>

        <p><br/>
            Information sent or received over the Internet is generally unsecure and we cannot and do not make<br/>
            any representation or warranty concerning security of any communication to or from the Platform or any<br/>
            representation or warranty regarding the interception by third parties of personal or other information. You<br/>
            must exercise caution when accessing your account from a public or shared computer so that others are<br/>
            not able to view or record your password or other personal information. You are responsible for<br/>
            safeguarding the password that you use to access the Platform and you are responsible for any
            activities<br/>
            or actions under your password. You agree to keep your password secure. You agree to notify us<br/>
            immediately of any unauthorized access to or use of your user name or password or any other breach of<br/>
            security. You also agree to ensure that you logout from your account at the end of each session. You
            are<br/>
            responsible for any password misuse or any unauthorized access. We will not be liable for any loss or<br/>
            damage arising from your failure to comply with these requirements.<br/>
            26. REVIEWS<br/>
            When a review is published it will be identified by the given name you entered when creating your<br/>
            account; no other potentially identifying personal information will be attributed to that post. By providing
            a<br/>
            review you acknowledge and consent to us using your given name in association with the review. All<br/>
            interactions on this site are governed by Company Privacy Policy and these Terms. All reviews that we<br/>
            receive are moderated before we publish them. We do this to make sure that reviews don&#39;t contain
            bad<br/>
            language, personal details people have entered by accident, or irrelevant comments.</p>

        <p><br/>
            27. COURIER AND RESTAURANT USERS</p>

        <p><br/>
            If you are a Courier User or a Restaurant User on our network, this section applies to you. Except to<br/>
            the extent that you also use Platform and related activities as a customer, only the provisions of
            these<br/>
            Terms that govern the use of the Platform software and the digital interface with our network apply to
            you,<br/>
            and your Existing Agreement (as defined below) with us remains the primary agreement between you and<br/>
            us. To the extent the terms of your Existing Agreement are less restrictive than, or otherwise conflict
            with,<br/>
            the terms and conditions herein, the more restrictive or conflicting terms and conditions herein apply,
            but<br/>
            solely with respect to the use of the Platform software and the digital interface with our network. If
            your<br/>
            Existing Agreement does not contain provisions that are at least as restrictive as Sections 20, 21 and
            22,<br/>
            those provisions apply to you, but they only affect our or your rights or obligations hereunder.</p>

        <p><br/>
            28. GENERAL</p>

        <p><br/>
            These Terms, together with Company&#39;s Privacy Policy, constitute the entire agreement between the<br/>
            parties relating to the Platform and all related activities, except to the extent that you are a Courier
            User or<br/>
            a Restaurant User on our network, in which case Section 27 of these Terms governs the interaction
            between<br/>
            these Terms and your separate Courier or Restaurant agreement with us (your &quot;Existing Agreement&quot;).
            If<br/>
            any part of these Terms is held to be unlawful, void, or unenforceable, that part will be deemed severed</p>

        <p><br/>
            12</p>

        <p><br/>
            and will not affect the validity and enforceability of the remaining provisions. The failure of Company
            to<br/>
            exercise or enforce any right or provision under these Terms will not constitute a waiver of such right
            or<br/>
            provision. Any waiver of any right or provision by us must be in writing and will only apply to the specific<br/>
            instance identified in such writing. You may not assign these Terms or any rights or licenses granted<br/>
            hereunder, whether voluntarily, by operation of law, or otherwise without our prior written consent. We
            may<br/>
            assign these Terms without restriction.</p>

        <p><br/>
            29. GOVERNING LAW AND JURISDICTION</p>

        <p><br/>
            The Platform and these Terms will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of<br/>
            the Province of Alberta and the federal laws of Canada applicable therein, without giving effect to any
            choice<br/>
            or conflict of law provision, principle or rule and notwithstanding your domicile, residence or
            physical<br/>
            location.</p>

        <p><br/>
            Any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to the Platform and under these Terms will be<br/>
            instituted in the courts of the province of Alberta and/or the Federal Court of Canada, and each party<br/>
            irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts in any such action or proceeding. You waive<br/>
            any and all objections to the exercise of jurisdiction over you by such courts and to the venue of such
            courts.</p>

        <p><br/>
            30. WAIVER</p>

        <p><br/>
            No waiver under these Terms is effective unless it is in writing and signed by an authorized<br/>
            representative of the party waiving its right. No failure to exercise, or delay in exercising, any right,
            remedy,<br/>
            power or privilege arising from these Terms operates, or may be construed, as a waiver thereof. No
            single<br/>
            or partial exercise of any right, remedy, power or privilege hereunder precludes any other or further
            exercise<br/>
            thereof or the exercise of any other right, remedy, power or privilege.</p>

        <p><br/>
